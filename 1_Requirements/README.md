 # Requirements
  ## Introduction
  - A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - The project is  simple scientific calculator which perform addition,substraction,multiplication,division,modulus,factorial and power of numbers.
  - The user can easily calculate. 

## Cost and Features
- Cost is less.
### Features are as follows:
 - Easy to understand.
 - Easy to find  Addition, substraction, multiplication ,divide power,modulus and factorial of numbers. .
 - Recognize the numbers it is works for given number or not like addition is work for two zero numbers or not.

## SWOT Analysis
### S- Strength
- Works in all kind of operating system.
- Easy to understand
### W- Weakness
- It's in command Line. 
### O- Opportunity
- we can make it's GUI.
- We can give more functions.
### T- Threat
-  It is bit slower.

## 4W'S and 1'H
### Who:
- The user can used to add ,substract ,multiplication and division of two numbers and more options are available to perform mathematical functions.
### What:
- To calculate two numbers using different functions.
### When:
- When user need the correct answers for mathematical operations. 
### Where:
- It is useful for  students ,many others can use the calcultor.
### How:
